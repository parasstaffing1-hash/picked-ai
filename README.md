# Picked AI Visibility Scanner — 14-Day MVP

A SaaS-style AI Visibility & Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) scanner.
Evaluates how conversational AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini) and search engines recommend your business vs. competitors across 10 high-value customer buyer queries.

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Page Website Crawling:** Crawls homepage, `/about`, `/services`, `/contact` (or Estonian equivalents) using clean HTML/DOM extraction and JSON-LD schema parsing.
- **Business Entity Profiling:** Automatically extracts business name, industry, city/location, language, services, description, and target customers.
- **10 Customer Buyer Queries:** Generates 10 high-intent customer prompts in English or Estonian (commercial, transactional, comparison, local, reputation).
- **Parallel Multi-Model Auditing:** Evaluates 10 questions across 3 engines (OpenAI, Gemini, Google Search visibility) = 30 observations in parallel under 3 minutes.
- **Structured Mention & Competitor Extraction:** Identifies exact and fuzzy brand mentions, recommendation rank/position (#1, #2, #3), competitor companies mentioned, and cited source URLs.
- **Transparent 0–100 Scoring:** Calculates overall score, OpenAI score, Gemini score, Google search score, competitor share of voice, and citation rates.
- **Dedicated Report Page (`/report/[scanId]`):** Executive presentation with KPIs, competitor comparisons, citation sources, and actionable GEO recommendations.
- **Automated Lead Capture & Email Delivery:** Saves user email, business profile, and scan score as leads, and dispatches HTML reports via Resend.
- **Bilingual:** Full native support for English and Estonian (Eesti).
- **Strict Search Transparency:** Clear separation of legitimate organic search indexing from conversational LLM recommendations—no scraping Google or fabricating AI Overview rankings.

## Database Migration Instructions

To run migrations in Supabase:

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard -> **SQL Editor**.
2. Run the script found in `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`.
3. The migration sets up:
   - `leads` (id, email, created_at)
   - `scans` (id, lead_id, url, business_name, industry, city, language, status, progress, error, dates)
   - `questions` (id, scan_id, question, language, order_index)
   - `ai_responses` (id, scan_id, question_id, engine, model, raw_response, response_json, duration_ms, status)
   - `mentions` (id, ai_response_id, business_mentioned, position, confidence, evidence)
   - `competitors` (id, ai_response_id, name, url, position)
   - `sources` (id, ai_response_id, title, url, domain)
   - `reports` (id, scan_id, overall_score, openai_score, gemini_score, google_score, report_json)
   - Indexes and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Local Development & Testing

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run test suite
```bash
npm test
```

### 3. Start local dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Running a Demo Scan
Set `DEMO_MODE="true"` in `.env.local` to run full scans without consuming external API credits. Demo mode uses realistic mock responses and clearly labels them as `(demo)`.

## Enabling Production AI Providers

To run live audits with real external models, configure the following in `.env`:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For live ChatGPT queries (`gpt-4o-mini` or custom model).
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For live Gemini queries (`gemini-3.8-flash`) and Google Search Grounding.
- `SERPAPI_API_KEY` (or `SERPER_API_KEY`): For live Google AI Overviews extraction from real SERP blocks. If omitted, Google GenAI Search Grounding (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) is automatically utilized as the official Google engine backing AI Overviews.
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: For delivering executive HTML reports to user emails.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` & `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: For PostgreSQL persistence.

## 10-Business Real-World Validation Suite

As mandated by Contract Requirement 26, the complete end-to-end scanner pipeline is validated across 10 real-world commercial websites (5 English, 5 Estonian):

```bash
# Run the complete 10-business validation suite
npm run validate
```

Tested targets:
- **English (5)**: Veriff (`veriff.com`), Pipedrive (`pipedrive.com`), Wise (`wise.com`), Bolt (`bolt.eu`), Stripe (`stripe.com`)
- **Estonian (5)**: Kliinik 32 (`kliinik32.ee`), Confido (`confido.ee`), Sorainen (`sorainen.com`), LHV (`lhv.ee`), Äripäev (`aripaev.ee`)

The test harness runs multi-page crawling, business profiling, 10-question generation, 3-engine audits (30 observations per business, 300 total), raw response persistence, mention/rank analysis, score calculation, report storage, and generates a structured summary in `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.

## Interactive UI Architecture & Open-Source Attribution

In accordance with Section 5 of the MVP specification, the interactive dashboard incorporates UI patterns and intelligence features adapted from permissively licensed (MIT) open-source GEO projects:

- **`ScoreGauge.tsx`**: Radial SVG animated circular progress indicators for overall and per-engine GEO visibility scores.
- **`CompetitorBattlecards.tsx`**: Comparative head-to-head battlecards (inspired by `danishashko/geo-aeo-tracker` MIT) tracking AI share of voice, average ranking positions, and queries won.
- **`CitationOpportunitiesView.tsx`**: Authority gap analysis (inspired by `danishashko/geo-aeo-tracker` MIT) pinpointing high-priority external citation domains where competitors are recommended while the target business is missing, complete with CSV export.
- **`ModelResponseDrawer.tsx`**: Side-by-side prompt and model response comparator (inspired by `aryamantodkar/oneglanse` MIT) allowing users to inspect actual raw responses, citations, and evidence from OpenAI, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews.
